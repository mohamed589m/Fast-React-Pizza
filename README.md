# React + Vite

## Project description
In the fast-paced world of restaurant management, efficient order management is crucial to ensuring customer satisfaction and maintaining a competitive edge. Our Priority Order Update System is designed to help restaurants streamline their order management process by providing a simple and intuitive way to update order priorities in real-time. Built with React Router Dom, this project showcases a seamless integration of front-end and back-end technologies to provide a robust and scalable solution.

### Problem Statement:
Restaurant staff often face challenges in managing orders, particularly during peak hours. Orders may need to be prioritized based on various factors such as customer requests, order complexity, or time-sensitive requirements. However, manual order management processes can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and may lead to delays in fulfilling orders. This can result in dissatisfied customers, negative reviews, and ultimately, a loss of business.

### Solution:
Our Priority Order Update System addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly interface for restaurant staff to update order priorities with ease. The system consists of a simple form that allows staff to mark orders as priority with a single button click. The updated order priority is then reflected in real-time, ensuring that all stakeholders are informed and aligned.

### Key Features:
